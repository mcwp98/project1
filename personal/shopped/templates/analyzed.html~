                <h2>Original Image</h2>
                <p>This is your original image.  It always pays to carefully look at your image. Here are a few things to look for:</p>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Faces - look for distortions around facial features, as these are generally easy to notice</p></li>
                    <li><p>Edges - often times edges are distorted or blended poorly</p></li>
                    <li><p>Lighting - look for differences in shadows and shading, as sometimes photoshopped images have lighting that conflicts with the environment.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <p>After you have taken stock of all the original image has to offer, move on to the error-level analysis(ELA) below.

                <h2>Error-Level Analysis</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>Error level analysis of an image involves resaving an image at a known
                    lesser quality rate (95%, in this case) and then calculating the difference
                    between the original and resaved images.  Some things to look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Rainbowing - Drawing programs may introduce a rainbow effect on surfaces of a flat color.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Highlighted distinctions - splices may introduce visible lines</p></li>
                    <li><p>Differing error pattern - pieces of image from different sources will show different levels of degredation.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Distorted error pattern - error pattern may show signs of smudging or stretching.</p></li>

                <h2>Super-Saturation</h2>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>For this one, you are on your own.  I read somewhere that super-saturating a photo may be useful in distinguishing distortions and irregularities within a photo.  Honestly, I find the ELA easier to interpret.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>As a later addition to this tool, I intend to introduce the ability to seperate red/gree/blue layers into 3 images, because I have also heard that this may help.  Who knows?</p>
